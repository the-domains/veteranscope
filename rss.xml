            <description><![CDATA[<p>Aims students to focus on veterans By GPD on April 21, 2016 Loveland Veterans Club of Aims Community College to raise awareness about veteran suicide at new fundraising event, Aim for Zero, on April 22 Aims Community College students trying to raise awareness about military veteran suicide created a new fundraiser April 22 based on the number 22. Tickets for the event, Aim for Zero: The Last 22, are $22. The money generated from the event will go to 22Kill, a global nonprofit based in Dallas, Texas, that aims to raise awareness about the suicide epidemic and post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. The number 22 also refers to the number of veterans who die by suicide every day. “It’s going to be a number to remember,” said Steven O’Neal, president of the Loveland Veterans Club of Aims Community College, a student club at the Loveland campus, 104 E. Fourth St. “They’re going to remember there are 22 veterans killing themselves a day.” Aim for Zero at the Best Western Hotel will feature dinner, silent and live auctions and raffle tickets selling for $22. So far, 140 tickets have sold with 20 tickets left, and if tickets sell out, the event is expected to raise $17,500 or more.</p>]]></description>
