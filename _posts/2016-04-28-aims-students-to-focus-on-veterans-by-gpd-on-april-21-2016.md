Tickets for the event, Aim for Zero: The Last 22, are $22. The money generated from the event will go to 22Kill, a global nonprofit based in Dallas, Texas, that aims to raise awareness about the suicide epidemic and post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. The number 22 also refers to the number of veterans who die by suicide every day. “It’s going to be a number to remember,” said Steven O’Neal, president of the Loveland Veterans Club of Aims Community College, a student club at the Loveland campus, 104 E. Fourth St. “They’re going to remember there are 22 veterans killing themselves a day.” Aim for Zero at the Best Western Hotel will feature dinner, silent and live auctions and raffle tickets selling for $22. So far, 140 tickets have sold with 20 tickets left, and if tickets sell out, the event is expected to raise $17,500 or more.'
